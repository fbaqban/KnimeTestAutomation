# This is a UI E2E test using Selenium webdriver in C# language

## Description:
Welcome Dear Developers, This is where you will find End-To-End as well as API automation tests where you are free to contribute too. 
You can contribute by giving your scripts written in C# and you think are amazing for other people to see.

The KNIME Hub (https://hub.knime.com/) is a place where KNIME users can share workflows with each other. 
Once you have created an account you can create so-called spaces which are containers for workflows, data files, and other things.

1- The UI task is to write an automated test to check whether space creation and deletion works for logged in users (you can create a free account in case you don’t
have one already). 

2- The API task is to write an automated test of the underlying REST API that checkswhether space creation and deletion works for logged in users (you can create a free account in case you don’t have one already). 
By inspecting the requests sent by the browser you can derive the REST calls needed for the scenario. Note that the Web UI makes more calls than necessary, you can for example ignore any OPTIONS requests. All REST calls are sent to api.hub.knime.com.
